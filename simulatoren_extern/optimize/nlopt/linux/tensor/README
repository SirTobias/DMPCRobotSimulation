This is the implementation by Robert Schabel et al of the algorithm
described in:

	T. Chow, E. Eskow, and R. Schnabel, "Algorithm 739: A software
	package for unconstrained optimization using tensor methods,"
	Transactions on Mathematical Software, vol. 20, no. 4,
	p. 518-530 (1994).

The original source code is in Fortran 77, and was converted to C
by Steven G. Johnson (August 2007) via f2c plus manual cleanup.

Permission to use/redistribute this code under the terms of the MIT
license was received in personal communication with R. Schabel (see
the COPYING file). In addition, Prof. Schabel politely requests that
any changes to the code/algorithm be clearly marked as such, and of
course that you reference the above paper in any publication for which
you used the algorithm.

Unfortunately, since it was published in ACM TOMS, it seems to be
under the restrictive (semi-free) ACM copyright conditions, regardless
of Prof. Schnabel's kind permission.
